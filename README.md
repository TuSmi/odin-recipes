# odin-recipes

This project is a website with a homepage that links to three other webpages, each displaying a recipe.

Each recipe will have a:
 
- Heading
- An image of the finished dish
- An unordered list of ingredients
- An ordered list of instructions to create the dish

In completing this project I will:

- Create a well organised website directory with multiple pages 
- Link to pages using relative linking
- Use HTML elements like headings and paragraphs to format text
- Imbed images using anchor tags
- Create ordered and unordered lists
