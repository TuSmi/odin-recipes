        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            Shakshuka is an easy, healthy breakfast (or any time of day) recipe from North Africa and the Middle East. It's a simple combination of simmering tomatoes, onions, garlic, spices and gently poached eggs. It's nourishing, filling and one recipe I guarantee you'll make time and again.
        </p>

        <p>
            Shakshuka spices may vary, but you'll commonly find paprika, cumin and chili powder, along with fresh garlic. I'd consider it flavorful spicy, not hot spicy. Though you can always add cayenne pepper if you'd like to heat it up.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, seeded and diced</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes</li>
            <li>6 large eggs</li>
            <li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1 small bunch fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
            <li>1 small bunch fresh parsley, chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Heat olive oil in a large sauté pan on medium heat. Add the chopped bell pepper and onion and cook for 5 minutes or until the onion becomes translucent.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Add garlic and spices and cook an additional minute.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Pour the can of tomatoes and juice into the pan and break down the tomatoes using a large spoon. Season with salt and pepper and bring the sauce to a simmer.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Use your large spoon to make small wells in the sauce and crack the eggs into each well. Cover the pan and cook for 5-8 minutes, or until the eggs are done to your liking.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Garnish with chopped cilantro and parsley.</p>
